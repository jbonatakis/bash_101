Ruff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honahlee
Little Jackie paper loved that rascal puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff oh
Ruff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honahlee
Ruff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honahlee
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flag when puff roared out his name oh
Ruff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honahlee
Ruff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honahlee
A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
Ruff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his life-long friend, puff could not be brave
So Ruff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave oh
Ruff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honahlee
Ruff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honahlee
